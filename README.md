Transformer-Based Market Recommendation System
This project implements a transformer-based model for generating market recommendations (Buy, Sell, Hold) based on historical trading data and technical indicators. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training using a custom transformer model.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that predicts market actions (Buy, Sell, Hold) by analyzing historical trading data. The project utilizes technical indicators and a transformer-based architecture to make predictions.

Key Features:
Technical Indicators: Added momentum, volume, volatility, and trend indicators to the dataset using the ta library.
Transformer Model: Custom-built transformer model for market prediction with an architecture designed to handle sequential financial data.
Training and Evaluation: The model is trained on historical data, and predictions are generated for market actions.

Dependencies:

pandas
numpy
torch
transformers
ta
scikit-learn


Model Architecture
The model is a transformer-based neural network consisting of the following components:

Embedding Layer: Converts input features into higher-dimensional space.
Transformer Block: Processes sequential data to capture dependencies.
Fully Connected Layer: Outputs predictions for market actions (Buy, Sell, Hold).
